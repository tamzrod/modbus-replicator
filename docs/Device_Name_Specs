# DEVICE_NAME — Identity Semantics

This document defines the **identity semantics** of `DEVICE_NAME` within the Modbus Replicator + MMA system.

This is a **behavioral specification**.
No code.
No implementation detail.
If a behavior is not stated here, it does not exist.

---

## Purpose

`DEVICE_NAME` represents **device identity**, not device state.

It exists to:

* give humans a stable identifier
* allow downstream systems to label data correctly
* re‑establish identity after trust boundaries are crossed

It does **not** exist to:

* indicate liveness
* indicate health
* act as telemetry
* act as a heartbeat

Identity is static by nature. Treating it as dynamic is an error.

---

## Identity vs Telemetry (Core Principle)

> **Identity is orthogonal to state.**

* State may change frequently
* Identity must not

`DEVICE_NAME` must therefore follow **different write rules** than status or data fields.

---

## Write Rules (LOCKED)

`DEVICE_NAME` is written **only** under the following conditions:

1. **Replicator startup**
2. **Replicator reconnect to MMA**
3. **MMA memory reset or trust loss**

It is **never written**:

* during normal polling
* during status updates
* on every cycle
* as part of routine writes

If none of the write conditions are met, **silence is correct behavior**.

---

## Placement Rule (LOCKED)

`DEVICE_NAME` is always located at the **end of the status block**.

This placement is intentional and mandatory.

Reasons:

* allows partial status writes
* allows writers to stop early
* minimizes packet size
* preserves RBE behavior

Early fields may be written without touching identity.

---

## Silence Semantics

Silence regarding `DEVICE_NAME` means:

> **Identity is unchanged and trusted.**

Silence does **not** mean:

* identity missing
* identity unknown
* identity invalid

Silence is meaningful only because trust rules are explicit.

---

## Trust Boundaries

A trust boundary is crossed when:

* MMA restarts
* MMA memory is cleared
* the replicator reconnects after loss of connectivity

Crossing a trust boundary invalidates any assumption about identity persistence.

In these cases, `DEVICE_NAME` **must be re‑asserted**.

---

## Restart Scenarios

### MMA Restart

* MMA memory may be empty or invalid
* Replicator must re‑write `DEVICE_NAME`
* Identity becomes authoritative again

### Replicator Restart

* Identity is known locally
* Identity is written once after reconnect
* Normal silence resumes

### Network Interruption

* Identity is re‑written only if MMA trust is lost
* Temporary transport failures do not trigger identity writes

---

## Size and Constraints

* `DEVICE_NAME` has a fixed maximum length
* Excess characters are truncated
* Encoding is ASCII only

Exact limits are defined in `STATUS_BLOCK_LAYOUT.md`.

---

## What DEVICE_NAME Is NOT

`DEVICE_NAME` is **not**:

* telemetry
* metadata
* configuration
* heartbeat
* versioning
* ownership

It is **identity only**.

---

## Design Rationale

Writing identity repeatedly:

* wastes bandwidth
* breaks RBE semantics
* increases packet size
* creates false change signals

Placing identity at the end of the block allows:

> **The fastest update — no update.**

Identity is written rarely so that everything else can be written efficiently.

---

## Summary

* Identity is static
* Silence is correct
* Re‑assert only on trust loss
* Never mix identity with telemetry

`DEVICE_NAME` exists to make the system **human‑readable without making it noisy**.

That balance is intentional and must not be broken.
