# Modbus Replicator

A one-way Modbus data replication service.

## Purpose

Read data once from a field Modbus device and replicate it verbatim
into a target memory endpoint.

Primary design target:
- Modbus Memory Appliance (MMA)

This project is intentionally dumb, deterministic, and boring.
